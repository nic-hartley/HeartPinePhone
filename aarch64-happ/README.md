# aarch64-happ

A custom rustc target to build against the HeartPinePine syscalls.
This just produces the literal binary.
If you want to package it up into a Heart app, you need to use `cargo-happ`.
You'll probably never use this directly unless you're debugging.

(I have literally no idea how this is going to look yet.)
